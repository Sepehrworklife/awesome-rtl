## Quality standards
To be included in the list, a tool should adhere to the following quality standards:

- It must have **built-in RTL support** or **official plugins**. Unofficial plugins are not accepted due to the risk of discontinuation, which could result in the loss of RTL support.
- It should not be exclusively designed for local audiences in RTL language countries, unless it has international usability and includes English language support.

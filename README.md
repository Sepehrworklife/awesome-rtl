## Rules for Introducing RTL Support Tools

- Only introduce tools that have **built-in RTL support** or **official plugins**. Unofficial plugins are not accepted due to the risk of discontinuation, which could result in the loss of RTL support.
- Avoid introducing tools designed exclusively for local audiences in RTL language countries, unless they have international usability and include English language support.
